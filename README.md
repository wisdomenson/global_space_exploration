In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of the global space exploration dataset 
to uncover valuable insights into global space missions and innovations. 
I used Python and Artificial Intelligence (AI) together with my analytical skills 
to clean, enhance, analyse and visualise the data, which was sourced from “Kaggle”.
